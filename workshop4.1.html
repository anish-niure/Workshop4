    <p>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a popular online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole.
         The game is played on a variety of platforms, including PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, and is available as a free-to-play game on mobile devices.

        In PUBG, players are dropped onto an island with nothing and must scavenge for weapons, armor, and other supplies while fighting to be the last player or team standing.
         The game features up to 100 players in a single match, and the play area progressively shrinks over time, forcing players to confront each other and leading to intense, action-packed gameplay.
        
        PUBG has gained a large and dedicated following due to its immersive gameplay and intense, tactical combat. However, it has also faced controversy due to its violent content and potential impact on players, particularly young people.</p>
